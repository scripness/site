Not just one layer.\n\n3. **Remote and async:** Almost every role is listed as \"Remote.\" Only 2 of 14 company roles were in-office. 13 years of remote contract work.\n\n4. **AI-assisted workflows:** FinancialDocs was \"delivered entirely using agentic AI workflows.\" NIXAP mentions \"developed with AI-assisted workflows.\" Frame as current practice, not a career-long identity.\n\nThe section heading \"How I work\" can stay but the subtitle must be factual (remove \"Clear expectations, fast feedback loops, and a bias for shipping the right thing with the least surprise\").\n\nCard styling preserved: `rounded-2xl border border-[#e0d2c4] bg-white/70 p-4` in a `grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2` layout.",
